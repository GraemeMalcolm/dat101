# Hypothesis testing

Statistics deals with relationships between data that allow for random variance. This enables you to calculate how *probable* (or _**im**probable_) an observed value for a variable is - specifically, determining whether the observed value is likely the product of random chance, or if there's some other factor at work. This kind of analysis is known as *hypothesis testing*.
