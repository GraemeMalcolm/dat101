# 1: Introduction to data science

## Welcome

Welcome to the course, we're glad you're here!

This course is designed to introduce you to the core concepts of data science. It's not a deeply technical course, and you won't need a deep understanding of statistics, mathematics, or programming to complete it. Rather, the goal of this course is to give you an overview of what data science is and what kinds of things a data scientist does, and to provide you with the foundational knowledge you'll need to embark on a journey to become a data scientist.
